    <h2>Welcome to Taiwan</h2>

      <p>Taiwan and its surrounding islands, situated in East Asia at the northwestern edge of the Pacific, possess an endless variety of terrains, forests, agricultural products, and marine ecologies, as well as a diversity of ethnic cultures along with enchanting human customs and practices. In Taiwan, the cloud-piercing Taipei 101 tower and the frenetic 24-hour pace of life leave no doubt about the cosmopolitan nature of the cities, and the contrast between city and countryside, together with the blending of the old and the new, leaves you with the feeling of being in a time tunnel that passes from the past through the present and into the future.<br><br>Hakka villages are rich in rustic folkways, with cuisine and culture passed down through the generations. The farm and fishery produce offered in traditional markets form the ingredients of fine food all over Taiwan, satisfying the taste buds of diners from everywhere. The ancient capital, Tainan, is where history and urban life come together, with temples and historic sites that trace the area’s past. Sunset at Xizi Bay in Kaohsiung and the coastal scenery of Kending, coupled with local night markets and unique main-street characteristics, are powerful attractions for tourists from all over the world.<br><br></p>
